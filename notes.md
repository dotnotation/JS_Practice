    -add a button on a div that contains all of the reviews for a certain model/class instance that was currently selected and once the button is clicked it has to sort the reviews in descending order by id. Use sort()
    
    -make a counter and attach an event listener to increase the counter

    -make an event listener for a click on likes for each dog

    -select, create, and modify DOM elements/nodes
    
    -create a JS object with eS6 class syntax

    -instantiate JS objects and call methods on them

    -convert an arrow function to a regular function

    -convert a regular function to an arrow function
